Hi again!

On this week, I've been working on Kibotics templates, they need updates. I've also fixed the evaluator transmission on
synchronous exercises. 

In the synchronous exercises the chat messages now use DataChannels. In that way, the server load is lower. The chat 
and the retransmission is peer to peer (with WebRTC) instead of peer to server (with WebSockets).

On the templates update, the middla navbar no contains all the display windows. You can see the video 
[here](https://youtu.be/ErBj0bEjLMs).

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
