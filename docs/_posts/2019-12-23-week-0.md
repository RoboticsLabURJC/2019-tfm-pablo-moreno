Hi everybody!

I'm Pablo Moreno Vera, student of the master in [Telecommunication Engineering at
Rey Juan Carlos University](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/master/872-ingenieria-de-telecomunicacion).

I'm starting at blogging with this first post. I didn't try it before and I hope post every week.
My Post-Degree Project is about [Klibotics](https://kibotics.org/) and [Unibotics](https://unibotics.org/) platforms.

On my first week I must study about blogs with Jekyll.

I installed Ruby and Jekyll: I followed the [installations](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz/tree/master/docs_template) steps. But It's
so hard to everything works on the first try so I had some troubles. After I installed both softwares, I tried to launch the repository I cloned from [here](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz/tree/master/docs_template)
and copy into mine but I got this error: `/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/2.5.0/rubygems.rb:289:infind_spec_for_exe’: can’t find gem bundler (>= 0.a) with executable bundle (Gem::GemNotFoundException)`

To fix that problem I followed these steps:
1. I made a cat of the "Gemfile.lock" to guess the bundle version used. The version was "bundle 2.0.2"
2. I ran `gem bundler -v 2.0.2` to select the bundle version.
3. I ran `bundle update listen` to update the dependencies for that version.
4. I ran `bundle i` to activate that version.
5. Once I had the version updated and activated, I ran the `bundle exec jekyll serve` command to start my blog and ¡BINGO! it worked.
