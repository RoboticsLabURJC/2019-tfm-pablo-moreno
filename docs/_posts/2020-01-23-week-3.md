Hi again!

On my third week I've been working on two main projects. I've been continue learning about WebRTC, specially about RTCPeerConnections,
WebSockets and RTCPeerConnections and I've also learned about Django and Django-Channels.

On my WebRTC work I've finished a **Chat & Screen-sharing server**. You can check the progress on
my [youtube](https://youtu.be/G1qPhagzY6w) channel.
It has been a very hard work but It's almost finish. My last task is develop an option for media html div sharing.

On my Django work I've developed a **Chat server** using Django-Channels. It has been a bit more complicated
than develop the WebRTC chat but I got it with a minor aesthetic changes. The result can be seen in my [youtube](https://youtu.be/_QMhxT_xjw8) channel. The next task is implement a RTCPeerConnection with Django-Channels.
I must study the if media stream it's possible using Django-Channels and if It is, implement it on my server. The immediate problem
is that I'm using 1.11 Django version and the 1.1.5 Django-Channels version and the current Django
version is 3.0.2 and 2.4 for Django-Channels so I really don't know if this older Django-Channel version supports it.

And that's all about this week!
