Hi again!

On this week, I've been working on Kibotics-Server. It's a Django based server, so my previous work
has been too useful. The difference is that the previous Django examples where tiny comparing with this one.

On the first days I've finished developing the Video-Chat Django example. You can see the video 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqlMRcmAtHE).

On this last days I've been studying the code and I've been working on the chat. It's almost done but
I need a way to connect different users. The last, and best, option is using a token for each
chat room. This way It's better than using the simulation-id. Tha final step is adding different user with the same token
because the signaling server works fine and the channel are set.

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
