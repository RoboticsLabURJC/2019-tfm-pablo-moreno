Hi again!

On this week, I've been still working on Kibotics-Server. I've done a very first version of synchronous exercises and I've updated
the Scratch templates to work with both synchronous and asynchronous exercises.

The HTML-Django templates It's been a tough work but, at the end, I did it. Now there are two different scratch templates
for the three differents scratch exercises (individual, asynchronous and synchronous).

On the other side, I've been developing a "Share Code" option and run it on the other browser. I've finally done it, although
It needs a testing and fixing several features. You can chat with other user, stream the simulator, and send your code to run it 
on the other browser and sees it via streaming. You can watch an example [here](https://youtu.be/viNRkbHUdDQ).

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
