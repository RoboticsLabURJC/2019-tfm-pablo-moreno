Hi again!

On this week, I've been still working on Kibotics-Server. I've made a templates update. Now you can switch between 
"Theory-Code" and "Chat-Simulator" views. In addition, some check points have been added to synchronize both users. You only
can start the stream if both users have sent their code. And the run button is available only when the stream has started.
You can see the video  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsIJRUQndKY).

A search user button has been added to look for an available user in the web. The next step is programming the button intelligent
with the server features.

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
