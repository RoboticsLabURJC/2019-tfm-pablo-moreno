Hi again!

On this week I've been working in Python exercises. I had to modify the Python websim package
to support two robots in the same world. I've also modified the loading exercises page and
create the GoThroughForest python exercise. With that exercise, the four shared games are completed
(two for scratch and two for python).

I also had to update the kibotics-webserver templates with new icons. The most important update
is the flexible load for the user. With this implementation, the user can choose one of the
two robots for loading it code. In that way, you know wich robots is yours. You can see the 
video [here](https://youtu.be/VGnF2LMvNe8).

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
