Hi again!

On my second week I've been working on WebRTC tecnologies like WebSockets, RTCPeerConnection and DataChannels.
The main objective is develop a code to share a video element (in this case is the Kibotics websim) with othe user using WebRTC.

I've been studying differents examples from internet, mainly in the [WebRTC tutorials page](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/).
Following these tutorials I've develop the following examples:

1. stream_camera example. This example record the laptop camera and play it on an html video.
2. element_share. This example play a html embed video clicking in the "Start" button and play it on a second html video.
3. peerconnection_stream. This example it's a bit more complicated and record a html embed video and stream it via RTCPeerConnection
to a second html video. The example works perfect streaming the camera video but using the html embed video, the stream it's played in black.
4. RTCPeedConnectionServer. In this example I've developped a signalig WebRTC server to connect different user by pairs
with a unique token secuence.
5. chat_server. This last developped example uses the 4) example to implement a chat with DataChannels. It's a work in progress
and I hope to finish it tomorrow.

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
