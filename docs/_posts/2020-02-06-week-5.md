Hi again!

On this week, I've been still working on Kibotics-Server. I've finished develop the chat and I've developed the
video streaming. In addition, I've add a feature with which  only the WebSim simulator is transmitted, so It's perfect!.

In the chat code, I've added a palette color button so, depending on the state of the connection, the button color changes.
I've also created a user checker algorithm so only two users can be in the same chat at the same time.

In the stream code, I've finally achieved the video transmission via canvas. That's because the html WebSim element is a canvas
element. In that way, I could sed the streaming with no problems. I've also implement a disconnection code with perfects results.
You can see the progress [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AFm1MT47_s).

I've also created a new exercise to implement this media options and I had to create a new user to test this performance.

And that's all about this week!
