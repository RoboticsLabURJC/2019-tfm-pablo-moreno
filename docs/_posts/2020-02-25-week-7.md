Hi again!

On this week, I've been still working on Kibotics-Server. I've made a templates update. Now the first view includes the 
theory and the code. The second view includes the Chat and the simulator. I've also updated the synchronism between 
users and a big amount of visual changes. You can see the example [here](https://youtu.be/B6TqOt_Jp-Y).

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
