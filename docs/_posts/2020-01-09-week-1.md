Hi again!
On my first week doing different stuff I had to read a TFG of one of my partners named Rubén Álvarez. He made an amazing job and explained so much interesting things about kibotics organization, wich is where I belong.

Also, I had to test some code about screen sharing to develop on kibotics practices. I had tested some codes but they weren't useful so I finally found an insteresting code from [Muaz Khan](https://github.com/muaz-khan/) who uses **WebRTC** and It doesn't need any extrension or plugin at the browser. I've modifed the code to add JdeRobot information instead of him. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GloVpVrjjOk).

I've been learning about **WebSocket** and I've made a simple Server and Client communication:

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
