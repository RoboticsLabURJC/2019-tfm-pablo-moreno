Hi again!

It's been a while since my last post.

I've been very busy working on the server and I've done quite modifies on it.
I've completely redone the server templates and I've finished the synchronous exercises. In
addition, I've crated two synchronous exercises, now they are called "Juegos Compartidos", 
a followline f1 and a go-through-forest f1, both using artificial vision.

I've also modified the main page of the server and I've worked on the DataBase getting
different values from it.

You can see all the changes [here](https://youtu.be/Ly2T91au-mE).

My next steps are to develop two new Scratch exercises using infrared sensor or radar and,
on the other side, to develop the infrastructure to create synchronous exercises on Python.

And that's all about this week!

Pablo.
