I"â<p>Hi again!</p>

<p>On this week, Iâ€™ve been working on Kibotics-Server. Itâ€™s a Django based server, so my previous work
has been too useful. The difference is that the previous Django examples where tiny comparing with this one.</p>

<p>On the first days Iâ€™ve finished developing the Video-Chat Django example. You can see the video 
<a href="">here</a>.</p>

<p>On this last days Iâ€™ve been studying the code and Iâ€™ve been working on the chat. Itâ€™s almost done but
I need a way to connect different users. The last, and best, option is using a token for each
chat room. This way Itâ€™s better than using the simulation-id. Tha final step is adding different user with the same token
because the signaling server works fine and the channel are set.</p>
