I"n<p>Hi again!
On my first week doing different stuff I had to read a TFG of one of my partners named Rubén Álvarez. He made an amazing job and explained so much interesting things about kibotics organization, wich is where I belong.</p>

<p>Also, I had to test some code about screen sharing to develop on kibotics practices. I had tested some codes but they weren’t useful so I finally found an insteresting code from <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/">Muaz Khan</a> who uses <strong>WebRTC</strong> and It doesn’t need any extrension or plugin at the browser. I’ve modifed the code to add JdeRobot information instead of him. You can watch the video clicking in the follow image:</p>

<p>I’ve been learning about <strong>WebSocket</strong> and I’ve made a simple Server and Client communication:</p>
