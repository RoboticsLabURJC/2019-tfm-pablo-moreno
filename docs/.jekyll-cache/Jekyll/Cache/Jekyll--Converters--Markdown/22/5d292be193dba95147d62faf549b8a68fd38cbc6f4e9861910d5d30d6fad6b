I""<p>Hi again!</p>

<p>On this week, I’ve been working on Kibotics-Server</p>

<p>On my third week I’ve been working on two main projects. I’ve been continue learning about WebRTC, specially about RTCPeerConnections,
WebSockets and RTCPeerConnections and I’ve also learned about Django and Django-Channels.</p>

<p>On my WebRTC work I’ve finished a <strong>Chat &amp; Screen-sharing server</strong>. You can check the progress on
my <a href="https://youtu.be/G1qPhagzY6w">youtube</a> channel.
It has been a very hard work but It’s almost finish. My last task is develop an option for media html div sharing.</p>

<p>On my Django work I’ve developed a <strong>Chat server</strong> using Django-Channels. It has been a bit more complicated
than develop the WebRTC chat but I got it with a minor aesthetic changes. The result can be seen in my <a href="https://youtu.be/_QMhxT_xjw8">youtube</a> channel. The next task is implement a RTCPeerConnection with Django-Channels.
I must study the if media stream it’s possible using Django-Channels and if It is, implement it on my server. The immediate problem
is that I’m using 1.11 Django version and the 1.1.5 Django-Channels version and the current Django
version is 3.0.2 and 2.4 for Django-Channels so I really don’t know if this older Django-Channel version supports it.</p>
